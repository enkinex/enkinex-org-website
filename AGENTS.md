# enkinex-org-website

[enkinex.org](https://enkinex.org) — **Docusaurus 3** + TypeScript site
for the enkinex project (Semantic & Governance as Code). Deployed to
Cloudflare via Wrangler.

## Repo map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/governance/odcs|odps/` | Library pages + step-by-step KCL tutorials (the most complete content) |
| `docs/why-enkinex.mdx`, `docs/architecture.mdx`, `docs/composable-architecture/`, `docs/semantic/` | Framework narrative — mostly TODO placeholders |
| `blog/` | Docusaurus blog (authors/tags configured, no posts yet) |
| `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/theme` | Custom React components, landing page, theme overrides |
| `docusaurus.config.ts`, `sidebars.ts` | Site configuration |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | Cloudflare deployment config |

## Commands

`npm install` · `npm run start` (dev server) · `npm run build` ·
`npm run typecheck` (tsc — run before PR) · `npm run preview`
(build + wrangler dev) · `npm run deploy` (build + wrangler deploy —
human-gated). Playwright is available for e2e (`playwright` in
devDependencies).

## Standards

- MDX pages use the `TodoBanner` component for unfinished sections.
- Tutorials mirror the KCL libraries' module structure; keep them in
  sync with `enkinex-odcs` / `enkinex-odps` releases.
- Branch `<type>/<short-slug>`, Conventional Commits subset,
  squash-merge.

Enkinex is an open-source **Semantic & Governance as Code** project: KCL
libraries that implement open standards (ODCS, ODPS, OKF) and platform
configuration surfaces (Databricks Asset Bundles) as typed, modular code.

### Git workflow (locked)

- Branch slug: `<type>/<scope>-<short-summary>`; `type` ∈ `feat · fix ·
  refactor · docs · chore · test · infra · proj`.
- Commits: Conventional Commits subset `<type>(<scope>): <imperative ≤72>`,
  `Refs:` footer pointing at the plan section delivered, no `Closes:`/
  `Fixes:`/`Resolves:` (there are no GitHub Issues).
- **Never push, merge, or open PRs unless the user explicitly asks.** The
  iteration ends at a local commit. `gh` CLI is the only GitHub surface
  (ADR-0002): no GitHub MCP, no Actions, no Issues/Projects/Releases.
- Never force-push to `main`; never rewrite history.
- Before any repo edit: `git fetch origin`, confirm sync with `main`,
  create the branch. Commit at the end of the iteration.

### Mechanical enforcement

The rules above are enforced by git hooks in `.githooks/`, not by your
compliance: `commit-msg` checks the subject grammar and the `Refs:` footer,
`pre-commit` checks the enkinex remote and scans staged content for
credentials, `pre-push` checks the branch slug and refuses direct pushes to
`main` and history rewrites.

- **Never pass `--no-verify`.** If a hook refuses, fix the cause.
- Hooks are inert until a clone is pointed at them. If
  `git config --get core.hooksPath` is empty, run
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` before committing.
- Unattended runs use the headless profile (`opencode.headless.json`), where
  push, rebase, PR creation and PR merge are denied outright rather than
  prompted. Launch through `scripts/opencode-headless.sh` in enkinex-aiops.

### Project lifecycle

Repos plan at the root level: `plan/` (active plans; finished work moves
to `plan/done/`), `discovery/` (analysis feeding plans), `architecture/`
(ADRs). ADRs record one-way decisions only — procedural workflows are
defined as executable artefacts (agents, commands, loop tasks, plugin
hooks), never as ADR prose (ADR-0004, executable governance). Commit
`Refs:` footers point at the delivered `plan/` section.

### Model tiers (OpenRouter)

| Tier | Models | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Free | `:free` suffixed IDs | explore/triage, formatting, titles |
| Mid | `moonshotai/kimi-k2`, `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2`, `google/gemini-3.5-flash` | code edits, docs, tests |
| Frontier | `moonshotai/kimi-k3` (default), `anthropic/claude-opus-5`, `openai/gpt-5.6` family | plans, reviews, ADRs |

Do not switch tiers silently; model pins change only via PR.

### Code standards

- KCL libraries: one module per concern, docstrings on every schema and
  field (they feed `just docs`), `check` rules for enums/constraints,
  `kcl vet` fixtures under `test/`. Gate: `just check` (fmt + lint + test).
- Stage explicit paths only — never `git add -A` / `git add .`; skip
  anything that looks like a secret.
